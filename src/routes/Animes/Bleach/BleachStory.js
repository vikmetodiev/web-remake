            <h2 className="onePieceStory">Bleach is a Japanese shōnen manga series written and illustrated by Tite Kubo.
            Bleach follows the adventures of the hotheaded teenager Ichigo Kurosaki, who inherits his parents'
            destiny after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper (Shinigami, literally 'Death God')—
            a death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki.
            His new-found powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and
            guiding departed souls to the afterlife, and set him on journeys to various ghostly realms of existence.

            Bleach was serialized in the Japanese manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from August 17, 2001 to August 22,
            2016, with its chapters collected into 74 tankōbon volumes. The series has spawned a media franchise that
            includes an anime television series that was produced by Tokyo-based Studio Pierrot from 2004 to 2012,
            two original video animation (OVA) episodes, four animated feature films, ten stage musicals, and
            numerous video games, as well as many types of Bleach-related merchandise. A Japanese live-action
            film adaptation produced by Warner Bros. was released in 2018.</h2>
