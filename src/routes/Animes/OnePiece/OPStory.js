                <h2 className="onePieceStory">One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized
                    in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine since July 22, 1997, and has been collected into 94 tankōbon volumes.
                    The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after
                    unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the
                    Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the
                    Pirates. The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film produced by Production I.G,
                    and an anime series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally,
                    Toei has developed thirteen animated feature films, one original video animation and thirteen television specials.
                    Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games.
                    The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia
                    by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004,
                before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.</h2>
