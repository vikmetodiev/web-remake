                <h2 className="onePieceStory">Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. 
                It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks to gain recognition from his peers and also dreams of 
                becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is in two parts, the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, 
                and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri, 
                which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

                Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book)
                 form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex,
                  which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English adaptation of the series aired on 
                  Cartoon Network from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in 
                  Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes.</h2>
