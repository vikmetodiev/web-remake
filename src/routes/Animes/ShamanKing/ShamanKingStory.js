            <h2 className="onePieceStory">Shaman King (Japanese: Hepburn: Shāman Kingu) is a Japanese manga series written
            and illustrated by Hiroyuki Takei. This manga follows the adventures of Yoh Asakura as he attempts to
            hone his shaman skills to become the Shaman King by winning the Shaman Fight. Takei chose shamanism as
            the main theme of the series because he wanted a topic that had never been attempted before in manga.

            The Shaman King manga was originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump between 1998 and 2004. The individual chapters were
            collected and released in 32 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha. An animated television series was co-produced by TV Tokyo, NAS,
            and Xebec, which aired on Japan's TV Tokyo network from 2001 to 2002. The manga has also been reprinted in a kanzenban edition,
            and has spawned video games, a trading card game, and many types of Shaman King-related merchandise.</h2>
